Merge/unify KeyHandler and this. There are a lot of similar inputs. KeyHandler is basically the 
InputHandler for the keyboard. 

Use a lookup rather than having the button/axis name in the function. Save that for the 
specific controller handler instance.

How to handle button/axis inputs for the same action? E.g. "left" mapping to a) keyboard "D" 
button, but also to the grey stick x axis on a GC controller? I want to be able to access a) the 
value of the grey stick axis (for drift in increments between 0--1) and b) I want to know if the 
player just "pressed" "left". 

Maybe for each input have a value lookup (0/1 for buttons; 0--1 for axes) and also a "pressed" 
criteria, which for both could be "is the value > 0.2".
